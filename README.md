Working: 

Introduction:
The URL shortner api is used to create short URL by consuming long URL. The short URL will redirects automatically to the long URL.

URL Conversation:
The short URL is generated by converting numbers from base 10 to base 62. The base 10 digits are [0-9] and base 62 digits are[a-z][A-Z][0-9]. The base 62 provides significant number(depends on length of characters allowed in short URL) of characters for the generation of short URL.

Implementation:
The API is implemented using spring boot and MySQL. 
Spring  Initializer: start.spring.io
