## Working: 

### Introduction:
The URL shortner api is used to create short URL by consuming long URL. The short URL will redirects automatically to the long URL.

### URL Conversation:
The short URL is generated by converting numbers from base 10 to base 62. The base 10 digits are [0-9] and base 62 digits are[a-z][A-Z][0-9]. The base 62 provides significant number(depends on length of characters allowed in short URL) of characters for the generation of short URL.

### Implementation:
The API is implemented using spring boot and MySQL. 
Spring  Initializer: start.spring.io
Initialized the Mavan project with required dependencies, here we used Web and MySql.
The code is logically divided into different folders, config, controller, dto, entity, repository, service. The connection details are in application.property
